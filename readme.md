# Simon Game Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a Simon game using JavaScript and jQuery. This project will help you understand key JavaScript concepts such as functions, event handling, arrays, and DOM manipulation, along with jQuery for simplifying JavaScript code.

## Game Description

The Simon game is a memory game where players have to repeat an increasingly long sequence of button presses in the correct order. The game starts with one button flash, and each successful repetition adds another button to the sequence.

## Files Provided

You are provided with the HTML and CSS files to set up the basic structure and styling of the game. Your task is to implement the game logic in the JavaScript file (`game.js`).

## JavaScript Implementation (`game.js`)

You need to implement the following features in the `game.js` file:

1. **Variables**:

   - `buttonColours`: An array containing button colors (`["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]`).
   - `gamePattern`: An array to store the sequence generated by the game.
   - `userClickedPattern`: An array to store the sequence clicked by the user.
   - `started`: A boolean flag to check if the game has started.
   - `level`: A variable to track the current level of the game.

2. **Start the Game**:

   - The game starts when a key is pressed (for desktop) or automatically (for mobile).

3. **User Interaction**:

   - Detect button clicks, store the user's pattern, play corresponding sounds, and animate the buttons.
   - Call the `checkAnswer` function to verify the user's sequence.

4. **Check Answer**:

   - Compare the user's clicked pattern with the game-generated pattern.
   - If the user sequence is correct, move to the next level.
   - If the sequence is incorrect, display a "Game Over" message and reset the game.

5. **Next Sequence**:

   - Generate a random sequence of colors for the game.
   - Increment the level and display it.
   - Animate and play sounds for the new sequence.

6. **Play Sound**:

   - Play sound corresponding to each button.
   - The sounds are in the sounds folder in the provided starter code

7. **Animate Button Press**:

   - Animate button press to provide visual feedback.

8. **Start Over**:
   - Reset the game variables to start a new game.

## Deliverables

1. Implement the game logic in `game.js`.
2. Ensure the game works correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. Test the game thoroughly for any bugs or issues.
4. Document the code with comments for clarity.

This project will help you practice and improve your JavaScript and jQuery skills. Have fun coding!
